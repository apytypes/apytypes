.. APyTypes documentation master file.

Welcome to APyTypes' documentation!
===================================

APyTypes is a Python library to simplify finite word length design and simulation.
Written in C++, the focus is on performance and flexibility.

To install APyTypes, do

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install apytypes

Now, have a look at the examples and play around. Using an enhanced terminal, like
Jupyter Notebooks or Spyder, will provide a nicer output of the numbers.
