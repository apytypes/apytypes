.. APyTypes documentation master file.

Welcome to APyTypes' documentation!
===================================

APyTypes is a Python library providing algorithmic data types, both fixed- and floating-point in Python.
The main purpose is to simplify finite word length design and simulation.
Written in C++, the focus is on performance and flexibility.

To install APyTypes do:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install apytypes

To install the latest version from source, without having to set up git etc, do:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/apytypes/apytypes.git

Or look at the :ref:`development` instructions.

Now, have a look at the examples and play around. Using an enhanced terminal, like
Jupyter Notebooks or Spyder, will provide a nicer output of the numbers.
