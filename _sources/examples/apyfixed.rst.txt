APyFixed
========

APyTypes provide a class for configurable floating-point numbers: :class:`APyFixed`.

The numbers are represented as the underlying integer, the total number of bits and integer bits.
However, there are also convenience methods to do this either from a float, a string, or a bit-pattern.
One can also supply the number of fractional bits; two out of the three (total, integer, and fractional
bits) must be supplied.

Standard arithmetic operations are supported. The resulting number of bits depends on the operation.
For addition and subtraction, the maximum number of integer bits and fractional bits are used.
A single integer bit is added to make sure that the computation does not overflow.

For multiplication, the number of integer bits and fractional bits is the sum of the number of
integer bits and fractional bits of the included operands, respectively.
